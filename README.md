# 📦 InPost Paczkomaty - Home Assistant Integration

Track [InPost](https://inpost.pl/) parcels sent to a *Paczkomat®* (parcel locker) and monitor the occupancy of your
configured lockers.

> **Note:** The integration only tracks **en route** or **available for pickup** parcels. Parcels that have already been
> picked up or are otherwise delivered are ignored.

---

## How It Works

This Home Assistant integration tracks your parcels by fetching data from InPost servers via a **relay backend server**.

1. **Authentication:** You provide your **phone number** to the integration setup. You then receive an **SMS code**
   which you also provide.
2. **Data Flow:** This authentication data is passed to a backend server (hosted by @jakon89), which then uses it to
   query the official InPost servers for your parcel statuses.
3. **Polling:** Home Assistant polls the integration backend every **30 seconds** to retrieve the latest updates on your
   parcels.

## Entities

The integration creates entities for the overall account (phone number registered in InPost mobile app) and for each tracked parcel locker.

### Summary Entities

|:---------|:-------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sensor` | `inpost_[PHONE_NUMBER]_all_parcels_count`              | Total number of all tracked parcels bound to your phone number(Delivered + En Route + Ready for Pickup). |
| `sensor` | `inpost_[PHONE_NUMBER]_en_route_parcels_count`         | Number of parcels currently en route to any locker.                                                      |

### Per-Locker Entities

For each configured locker (identified by `[LOCKER_ID]`), the following entities are created:

| Platform        | Entity                                                     | Description                                                                        |

| `sensor`        | `inpost_[PHONE_NUMBER]_[LOCKER_ID]_locker_id`              | The public ID of the specific parcel locker.                                       |
| `binary_sensor` | `inpost_[PHONE_NUMBER]_[LOCKER_ID]_ready_for_pickup`       | $\text{True}$ if **any** parcels are available for pickup in this specific locker. |
| `sensor`        | `inpost_[PHONE_NUMBER]_[LOCKER_ID]_ready_for_pickup_count` | Number of parcels available for pickup in this specific locker.                    |
| `binary_sensor` | `inpost_[PHONE_NUMBER]_[LOCKER_ID]_parcels_en_route`       | $\text{True}$ if **any** parcels are en route to this specific locker.             |
| `sensor`        | `inpost_[PHONE_NUMBER]_[LOCKER_ID]_en_route_count`         | Number of parcels currently en route to this specific locker.                      |

* Expose phone number and access code via a Home Assistant entity or attribute.
* Add a `inpost_[PHONE_NUMBER]_[LOCKER_ID]_deadline` entity to monitor pickup deadlines for each ready-for-pickup parcel in a locker.
* Add branding images to https://github.com/home-assistant/brands
* Add this repository to HACS
* Remove relay backend server and call InPost API directly from the integration.

Please create a new GitHub Issue for any feature request you might have.
